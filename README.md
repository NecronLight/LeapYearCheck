# Leap Year Checker
This JavaScript code determines whether a given year is a leap year. A leap year is a year with an extra day, February 29th.

# Code Explanation:

The leapYears function takes a year as input and follows these steps:

    Checks divisibility by 4: If the year is divisible by 4, it's a potential leap year.
    Checks divisibility by 100: If the year is divisible by 100, it's not a leap year unless...
    Checks divisibility by 400: If the year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year.

The prompt function asks the user for a year, and the alert function displays the result.
